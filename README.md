3rd Program that I have coded while taking my coding course through c#.

Its another simple program that takes an input you give and spits something out using some logic.

Basically this program takes in a sentence and then scans for how many spaces there are, then it tells you, it scans for the spaces using the word.split function.
The word.split function has a (' ') appended to it meaning that it splits up the sentance into an invisible array containing each word, we can get the amount of words in the array by making the word.split function = to an integer which in this case we will call "length" then after some basic formatting to make it look better it just tells you how many words were in the sentence.

Then after 5 seconds it closes.

Disclaimer: Does not work with copy and paste, idk how to make it anyways so yeah.

One of my smallest programs but theres a lot of thinking put into it and tbh it took a while lol.
